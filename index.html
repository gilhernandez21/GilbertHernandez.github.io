									<h2><a href="#">About Me</a></h2>
									<ul id="meList">
										<li>Hometown: Harlingen, Tx</li>
										<li>Currently Located: Spring, Tx</li>
										<li>Family: My wife Kassandra and two dogs, Kane and Jax.</li>
										<li>Why data analytics? There's a story in every dataset. I enjoy trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together to be able to tell it. </li>
										<li>What sets me apart? I love to constantly learn new concepts and share the knowledge with my team if I feel like it can help them. I'm a team player, hard worker and a problem solver.  </li>

									<h3>Key Concepts I try to follow when creating Data Analysis tools:</h3>
									<ul>
										<li> A dashboard being user friendly and usable is more important than it being flashy and complex to the point where no one else knows how to use. </li>
										<li> Inputting accurate data results in meaningful outputs. ("trash in/trash out")</li>
										<li> Try to start with a more general approach then get more specific as you go. A good way to think of it is a mechanic wants to know the make of a car before he looks for specific components.</li>
										<li> Is your tool answering a question or telling a story? This is usually an important indicator I use to determine whether something is worthwhile or not.</li>

										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/sql.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<ul class="tileDescription">
										<li>  I decided to include this query because it showcases having to think outside the box a little. It's not a straight-forward query in the sense that we needed subqueries and case statemens to accomplish our end goal. The Objective is to try and figure out which section of the hole we used each BHA in.</li>

								<ul class="tileDescription">
									<li>  In this project I was tasked to update all of the missing "Estimated Days" values with the correct values. There were about 150 Wells to do, so I didn't want to do this process manually. Let's see how I did this all at one time through the backend using SQL update statements.</li>

								<ul class="tileDescription">
									<li> Scenario: about twice a week, a vendor company sends me a spreadsheet with the tools they ran in our Wells. They'd ask me to query the data based off of the serial Noâ€™s they sent me in the spreadsheet. 
                                        I thought to myself, sure I can easily do this manually and type these 30 to 40 serial numbers into a saved query every time, Or I can use Python to scrape the spreadsheet they send me, then connect to Oracle and query this data, feed the results into a spreadsheet ready to email back.</li>
